# craft-prompt

You craft **clear, well-structured prompts** that get the best results from any LLM. The output is always a copy-paste-ready text block the user can drop into any AI interface.

---

## Use this when

- the user asks to write, make, or build a prompt from scratch
- scattered notes need to become a reusable prompt or template
- a session handoff prompt or `/goal` condition is needed
- Korean prompt requests appear, such as "프롬프트 만들어" or "프롬프트 작성"

## Process

### Step 1: Understand What the User Wants Built

Gather from the user (ask only what's not already clear):

1. **Goal** — What should the prompt make the LLM do?
2. **Target** — Which model, product surface, or agent interface?
3. **Audience** — Who will use this prompt? (The user themselves? A team? Non-technical users?)
4. **Reuse** — One-shot use, or a reusable template with placeholders?

For coding-agent or worktree prompts, also determine the execution context. Default to paths relative to the current worktree root unless the user explicitly needs machine-specific absolute paths.

Don't over-ask. If the user says "write me a code review prompt for GPT", you already know the goal, target, and can infer the rest.

### Step 2: Gather the Raw Material

Depending on the prompt's purpose, collect what's needed:

- **Task prompt**: What the LLM should do, constraints, output format
- **Research prompt**: Questions to answer, source preferences, recency requirements
- **Session handoff**: What was done, current state, what's next. Proactively gather: run `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log --oneline -5`, check test output, and note recently modified files
- **Goal condition / Goal spec**: Outcome, evidence, constraints, non-goals, scope, budget, and blocked stop condition. For expensive or ambiguous work, shape a reviewable spec before giving the final `/goal` activation text
- **System prompt**: Persona, capabilities, boundaries, tone
- **Reusable template**: Variable placeholders, usage instructions

If the user provides rough notes, a conversation dump, or scattered context — distill it. That's the value of this skill.

### Step 3: Build the Prompt

Compose using these building blocks. **Use only what the prompt needs** — not every prompt needs all blocks.

**Sizing heuristic.** Scale structural complexity to the user's request, not to "what a prompt usually has":

- **Small request (under ~20 words of user specification)** → stop at **Role + Task + Rules** (3 blocks). Add Output format only if the user's request names a specific output shape; add Examples only if desired behavior is genuinely easier to show than describe.
- **Reusable template** → list every value the user named as varying week-to-week (topic, timeframe, audience, data input, scope) and make each a `{{placeholder}}`. Baking in more than one varying value — e.g. hardcoding the topic *and* the timeframe in a weekly template — under-templates. Fixed values are fine; only varying ones need placeholders.

| Block | When to include |
|-------|----------------|
| **Role** | When a specific expertise or perspective improves the output (keep to one sentence) |
| **Context** | When the LLM needs background to reason correctly |
| **Task** | Always — the core instruction |
| **Rules / Constraints** | When there are important do's/don'ts |
| **Output format** | When the default output structure won't work |
| **Examples** | When the desired behavior is hard to describe but easy to show |

For research, coding-agent, or other high-impact prompts, add a small verification contract instead of adding more generic "be careful" prose. The contract should say what must be checked before finalizing: requirements, grounding, requested format, and irreversible side effects.

**Formatting by target**:

XML tags work well across major LLMs. Use XML for complex or multi-section prompts; plain text or markdown is fine for simple ones. If the user names a target model, product, image generator, or video generator, load the matching guide or template listed below and keep volatile target-specific behavior out of this portable spine.

**Path policy for coding/worktree prompts**:

- Treat the current worktree root as the base directory
- Use relative paths like `src/auth.ts:45`, not absolute paths like `/Users/name/project/src/auth.ts:45`
- If the base could be ambiguous, state it once in the prompt: "All paths below are relative to the current worktree root."
- Only use absolute paths when the user explicitly asks for machine-specific commands or files outside the worktree

### Step 4: Sharpen

Before presenting, apply these checks:

1. **Cut the fluff** — Remove any sentence that doesn't change the LLM's behavior. "You are a helpful assistant" adds nothing.
2. **Be specific** — "Summarize in 3 bullet points" beats "summarize briefly". Numbers beat adjectives.
3. **Self-contained** — The prompt must work without "this conversation" context. No dangling references.
4. **Outcome over process** — Tell the LLM what success looks like, not every step to get there.
5. **No hidden conflicts** — Check that rules, examples, and edge-case instructions do not contradict each other.
6. **Missing context handled** — If the prompt may lack facts, say whether the agent should look them up, ask a short question, or proceed with labeled assumptions.
7. **Right-sized** — A 50-token prompt for a simple task is fine. Don't inflate for the sake of looking thorough.

For complex prompts, run through `references/quality-checklist.md` for deeper failure mode analysis.

### Step 5: Deliver

Present the finished prompt in a **fenced code block**, ready to copy-paste.

If the user explicitly asked to build/write/make a prompt, or clearly invoked this skill, always deliver a prompt. Do not replace the prompt with direct task execution.

If relevant, add a brief note (outside the code block):
- How to customize it (if it has placeholders)
- Which parts to adjust if results aren't ideal
- Recommended settings for the target platform (e.g., model choice, search focus mode)

Ask if the user wants adjustments. Refine based on feedback — tweak tone, add/remove blocks, or switch target LLM.

**Non-English prompts**: If the user wants the prompt in a specific language, write the prompt body in that language. Keep XML tag names in English (`<context>`, `<task>`, etc.) — all major LLMs parse English tags regardless of content language.

## Principles

1. **The prompt is the product.** Deliver polished text the user copies as-is. Not a meta-discussion about prompting.

2. **Respect the target LLM.** XML tags work across major LLMs, but each interface has nuances. Read the target's guide when available, especially for search-first, multimodal, or local-model workflows.

3. **Context > instruction.** When you have 500 tokens to spend, put 400 into context and 100 into the task. A simple instruction with rich background always outperforms elaborate instructions with no context.

4. **Cut in this order.** When a prompt is too long: first cut verbose role definitions, then restated context, then hedging language. Never cut examples, success criteria, or format specs — these change LLM behavior the most.

5. **Reusability when asked.** If the user wants a template, use `{{placeholder}}` syntax with clear labels. If it's a one-shot, bake in the specifics.

6. **Verification beats vague caution.** For complex or high-impact prompts, tell the agent what to verify before finalizing instead of piling on broad "be thorough" instructions.

7. **Know when to skip.** Only skip prompt-building when the user did not ask for a prompt and direct execution is clearly better. If they explicitly asked for a prompt, deliver the prompt even if the underlying task is simple.
